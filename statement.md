Problem Statement
Manual tracking of daily expenses can be tedious, error-prone, and inefficient for users.
People often struggle to record, categorize, and review their spending habits, leading to
poor financial decision making and lack of budget control. There is a need for a simple tool 
that lets users conveniently add, view, and total expenses in real time.​

Scope of the Project
The project implements a console-based application for basic personal expense management.
Its core scope includes adding new expenses, viewing a list of expenses, and calculating
the total expenditure during the session. It does not persist data after program exit, 
does not provide user authentication or analysis visualizations, and is intended as an 
educational demonstration of Java programming fundamentals.​
